        <h2>📜 Dear recruiter!</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Risto, I am currently 25 years old and my dream has always been to have a career in some IT field. In the
          summer of 2022, I obtained my bachelor's degree at TalTech, specializing in computer systems/hardware development and
          programming, where the main focus was on the planning, design, development and maintenance of computer-based information
          processing and electronic systems and various control and communication systems, so I can finally show a certificate
          that proves I know at least a little bit about computers. 😎
        </p>
    
        <p>
          However, I do not consider it as my greatest achievement, since I was actually always more dedicated to web development on the side of school, and am currently also looking for new challenges as a web developer. 👨‍💻
        </p>
    
        <p>
        <u>As of my experience</u> - I have been working as a full-time developer for over 3 years now in the web agency vDisain, where I have developed numerous (100+) websites and e-shops mainly in Wordpress. At vDisain, I haven't had one specific role, such as "front-end developer", there I have usually had to deal with every issue by myself, which basically means to be a front-end, back-end developer, system administrator (deal with different servers and domains), designer, SEO and an optimization/security expert all together - so I am confident to say that it has developed me a lot and that I am a more valuable web developer because of it. Nevertheless, I certainly still have some things to learn and I try to perfect my skills every day. I have also developed various projects as a freelance web developer in my own company.
        </p>

        <h2>🧑‍💻 More about me</h2>
    
        <p>
          I try not to limit myself with a single stack, my goal is to improve in every possible way by learning new web
          technologies, I am already familiar with several with programming languages / libraries / frameworks / platforms -
          definitely stronger in the front-end (it is also more interesting to me, because I like to see the result of my work
          immediately and I also enjoy designing a lot), mainly I have learned React.js and built different projects with it. My
          main goal is to someday reach the status of an experienced full-stack developer, and I am constantly working on it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Technologies I am familiar with:

          <a href="https://github.com/ristotoldsep/My-Tech-Stack" target="_blank"><button class="button-link">MY TECH STACK</button></a>


        </p>

        <p>
        Fun fact - when I’m not working, I am also a DJ, an entrepreneur, an investment enthusiast, a book lover, a football
        player and I enjoy going to the gym, so I am not quite an ordinary computer guy either.
        </p>

        <p>
          In any case, I consider myself a team player, a hard-working and adaptable person who always has the desire to learn and
          improve myself and to do my best <strong>to bring value to your company</strong>, if you gave me the opportunity. 🤝
